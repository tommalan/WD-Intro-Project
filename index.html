  <p><em>Looking at <strong>what I want to achieve</strong> in this pursuit</em></p>
  <p>After my encounters with many successful programmers at home and <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tomsleath/">on my travels</a></strong> I have decided to learn web development. This is a useful for jobs I may wish to undertake in the future. It's also translatable as it will give me a basic understanding of how the web works and a basic idea of how to code. This page will show the benefits of learning web development skills in greater detail.</p>
